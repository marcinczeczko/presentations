##  Event Bus

- messages are received using Handlers and delivered using the event loops - locally
- each vertx instance has access to the event bus
- event bus allows distributed communicatiion
- vertx creats cluster automatically
- almost anything can send/receive messages becuase we provided bridges.. (sockjs, websockets, etc.)
