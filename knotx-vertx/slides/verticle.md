##  Verticle

- is a program you write
- is always executed on the same thread

- an agent-like model (just start and stop methods to implement)
- can be instantiated multiple times
- dead verticles are restarted on a running node (in clused with HA mode)
- modern browsers keeps connection opens - so they keep to the same connection - thread- event loop
- HA for free - great demonstration !! with bare vertx instance..
