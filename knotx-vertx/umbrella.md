One growing alternative to the incorporation of individual projects is to join an umbrella organization. An umbrella organization is a single non-profit organization that is designed to provide infrastructure and support to many related or unrelated subprojects.
This single umbrella organization acts as the fiscal sponsor and corporate parent for the projects, allowing them to receive the benefits of non-profit incorporation while sharing some of the burdens.

In particular, projects organized under the unbrella organization receive the benefits described above, aithout actually having to form and maintain their own organizations.
Another benefit is that the only Board of Directors is a the level of the umbrella organizations, so open source projects comming in under an umbrella organization can usually keep the same organizational structure they had as a decentralized project.
This single professionalized organization can provide support to many seprate associated projects.
If your project already has substrantial corporate involvement, in may make sense to form your own non-profit organization. If your project needs the infrastructure provided by a non-profit, but is relatively new or growing, it may make sense to apply for membership in an umbrella organization.
As theses organizations are presently constituted, the option remains to form your own dedicated non-profit organization later.
The three most prominent umbrella organizations for free and open source software are the Free Software Foundation (http://www.fsf.org), the Apache Software Foundation, (http://apache.org/foundation), and the Software Freedom Conservancy (http://conservancy.softwarefreedom.org).
